Twitter Text Classification on the basis of Political views 

Text classification is a classic task in natural language processing. Given a text document and a set of categories, the text classification algorithm must assign the text document into one or more of the given text categories. We discuss classic text classification techniques in our course. As a project title in the domain of text classification, we suggest the task of short text classification, which is more challenging than classic document classification. In the proposed project title, we use the Twitter Political Corpus. Given a tweet, the task is to distinguish political tweets from non-political ones.

Corpus used : https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/nchamber/data/twitter/.
The two labels are *POLIT* (political) and *NOT* (not political).

Classifiers Used : 
 1. Multinomial NB
 2. Bernoulli NB
 3. SVC
 4. Logistic Regression 
 
**Confusion Matrix** and **Classification Report** plotted for these classifers

Pending : Neural Networks CNN
